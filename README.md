# 🔐 Password Generator Project

This is a small project for **automatic password creation** using Python.  
It includes **two different methods** implemented under separate folders:
- `method1/`
- `method2/`

## 📂 Project Structure
password_project/
├── method1/
│ └── main.py
│ └── my_module
├── method2/
│ └── main.py
└── README.md


## 💡 What I Learned
This project helped me practice and apply several Python concepts:
- `import` statements (using custom modules)
- `lists` and `sets`
- `for` loops
- `conditional statements` (`if`, `else`)
- user input handling
- randomization with the `random` module

## 🚀 How It Works
The user inputs the desired length of a password (between 8 and 16 characters), and the program generates a secure password using:
- uppercase and lowercase letters
- numbers
- symbols

Each method follows a slightly different logic to mix these elements.
